Seeking to balance on the razors edge of what we think we know about the physical world and concepts like love and the inherent physical and emotional feelings of such things, I wanted to express the double-sided conversation that often occurs when we are thinking about these wide-ranging and meaningful ideas; represented through the more traditional address of the poem (the external conversation, things you would d say to someone else), and the asides in parentheses (the inner conversation). In doing so, I hope to bring you as the reader, more fully into my inner world both as I contemplate what love looks like and means to me, a scientific and yet entirely inexplicable marvel, as well as into the process of writing the poem itself. I hope this inspires you to more closely examine the quieter, smaller (but in no way less important) conversations you have with yourself as you analyze what love means to you and how you connect that to other vast ideas in this world of ours.',

Her artistic interests range from acrylics and watercolors, to ceramics, photography, and mosaics, but by far her favorite is writing (truly horrible, but she thinks they are funny) historically based poetry. She is also extremely passionate about science communication, and you can often find her waxing poetic to university students about the importance of rocks in telling the stories of our earth; she will hold herself back tonight for your sakes though.',

Founded by the D.B Cooper hijacking suspect known as Hairbrushed, the company originally began as a modest art peddler but quickly transformed into a totalitarian powerhouse dominating almost every industry on earth. Hairbrushed is well-regarded for her cryptic artistic creations, most notably described as ‘drawing pictures’; as well as her controversial practices and operations. Over the years, the company has faced numerous allegations of human rights violations, including the mysterious disappearances of former executives and the widespread use of strange, forced ‘volunteer’ labour programs. These programs have allegedly involved individuals working in remote locations under questionable circumstances, often with reports of employees being made to trim prints on Hairbrushed’s living room floor. Whistleblowers claim that Hairbrushed’s reach extends far beyond public knowledge. If you’re reading this, they warn, there’s a strong possibility that the Hairbrushed Corporation is already tracking your every move. As of 2023, Hairbrushed has reportedly been detained at an undisclosed CIA black site, though the details surrounding this event remain unclear.
