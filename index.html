Seeking to balance on the razors edge of what we think we know about the physical world and concepts like love and the inherent physical and emotional feelings of such things, I wanted to express the double-sided conversation that often occurs when we are thinking about these wide-ranging and meaningful ideas; represented through the more traditional address of the poem (the external conversation, things you would d say to someone else), and the asides in parentheses (the inner conversation). In doing so, I hope to bring you as the reader, more fully into my inner world both as I contemplate what love looks like and means to me, a scientific and yet entirely inexplicable marvel, as well as into the process of writing the poem itself. I hope this inspires you to more closely examine the quieter, smaller (but in no way less important) conversations you have with yourself as you analyze what love means to you and how you connect that to other vast ideas in this world of ours.',

Her artistic interests range from acrylics and watercolors, to ceramics, photography, and mosaics, but by far her favorite is writing (truly horrible, but she thinks they are funny) historically based poetry. She is also extremely passionate about science communication, and you can often find her waxing poetic to university students about the importance of rocks in telling the stories of our earth; she will hold herself back tonight for your sakes though.',

Hairbrushed is well-regarded for her cryptic artistic creations, most notably described as ‘drawing pictures’; as well as her controversial practices and operations. Over the years, the company has faced numerous allegations of human rights violations, including the mysterious disappearances of former executives and the widespread use of strange, forced ‘volunteer’ labour programs. These programs have allegedly involved individuals working in remote locations under questionable circumstances, often with reports of employees being made to trim prints on Hairbrushed’s living room floor. Whistleblowers claim that Hairbrushed’s reach extends far beyond public knowledge. If you’re reading this, they warn, there’s a strong possibility that the Hairbrushed Corporation is already tracking your every move. As of 2023, Hairbrushed has reportedly been detained at an undisclosed CIA black site, though the details surrounding this event remain unclear.

            artistbio: 'The Squid Global - Nicola Petrides - is an international producer and cinematographer. A Molchanovs freediver, The Squid Global draws inspiration from her filmmaking career, along with her passion for freediving, in her photography to capture the cinematic quality of human connection. Working with the movement and natural lighting conditions of the open ocean to create dreamscapes filled with dynamic captures and cinematic motion blur, her work evokes the complex energy of human emotion, its ebbs and flows, and its beauty and violence, to capture a glimpse of a process rather than a fleeting moment in time. With a deep interest in how individuals respond to love, loss and trauma and build authentic relationships, The Squid Global also takes inspiration from the late fashion designer Alexander McQueen, his motifs of vulnerability, and his use of fashion as armour. She is also influenced by radio presenter and investigative journalist Ira Glass’ curious and tactful exploration of the complex situations humans find themselves in, as well as the late filmmaker David Lynch’s uncovering of the horrors, love, dark humour and authentic connection that lie beneath the veneer of modern society. The Spaces In Between Us is The Squid Global’s first exhibition and features six unique pieces shot in the open ocean in Egypt, Greece and Malta. All of her subjects are experienced freedivers. The Squid Global is a British and Australian citizen, who has lived and worked long-term in five countries as well as shooting in more than 50 countries. She resides in Fitzroy, Melbourne with her cat Ripley.',
